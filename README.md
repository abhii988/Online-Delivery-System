# Online-Delivery-System
Online Delivery System created using MySQL

The aim of this assessment was to create the system using Oracle SQL to keep a records and help solve the problems faced by an online delivery service with its daily transactions.
Different types of entities, attributes, constraints, and keys were created whilst creating this system.
Normalization of the developed database was not required so it was not done.
The whole process in development of this system is written in the report file where the ER and Relational diagram is also drawn.
